		<h2>Answer the following questions:</h2>
		<p class="questions">
			2a. If I utilize the term "all", what can I delete from the following code?     
          
               transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you utilitze the term "all" in the code above, you may eliminate the <em>background</em> property.
		</p>

		<p class="questions">
			2b. Define the following timing functions/transitioning elements:
           
             "CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration."

              <strong>Ease:</strong> Default value. Specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly, which is equivalent to cubic-bezier (0.25,0.1,0.25,1)
<hr>
              <strong>Linear:</strong> Specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end, which is equivalent to cubic-bezier (0,0,1,1)
<hr>
              <strong>Ease-in:</strong> Specifies a transition effect with a slow start, which is equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42,0,1,1)
<hr>
              <strong>Ease-out:</strong> Specifies a transition effect with a slow end, which is equivalent to cubic-bezier(0,0,0.58,1)
<hr>
              <strong>Ease-in-out:</strong> Specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end, which is equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42,0,0.58,1) 
<hr>
              <strong>Cubic bezier:</strong> Functional notation defines a cubic BÃ©zier curve. As these curves are continuous, they are often used to smooth down the start and end of the animation and are therefore sometimes called easing functions
